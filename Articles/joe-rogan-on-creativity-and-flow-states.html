<h2>Joe Rogan On creativity & Flow States</h2>
<p>Great talk!</p>
<p>Breaks down micro and macro-flow.</p>
<p>One point that stuck with me &#8211; time seems to be a concept/perception of the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>When you go into a flow state you prefrontal cortex become less active; similar to a psychedelic state or meditative state.</p>
<p>During the flow state, your body reduces cortisol levels &#8211; your stress hormone &#8211; causing you to become more calm, relaxed, and focused.</p>
<p>In an attempt to get into the flow state while I work I focus on my breathing.</p>
<p>My goal is to reach a pseudo flow state that will enhance creativity and clarity of thought.</p>
<p>I find focusing on my breath while working to be a bit of a chore &#8211; if I haven&#8217;t been doing it consistently when I sit down to work.</p>
<p>On the plus side, after a couple of weeks, deep breathing and the likelihood of trigging a flow state becomes more effortless as the habit is formed.</p>
<p>I wonder what benefits one would see if they maintaining this habit for 6 months while learning and programming.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the video &#8211; about 23 min mark &#8211; Rogan &amp; Kotler start talking about techniques that have helped them get into a flow state.</p>
<p>Listening to a song on repeat is an approach that I&#8217;ve heard from a few sources. Most notably <a href="https://tim.blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Ferriss</a>.</p>
