*Brain Dump* <br>

+ Created my [25/5 List](https://benjaminspak.com/25-5List/)
+ Completed copying down [Youtube Playbook](https://github.com/benjaminspak/YouTubePlaybook) v1

+ Keep going!

*Brain Dump* <br>

+ Been slacking a bit with code & org growth, but got to see friends this weekend.
+ The Mcgregor fight was cray!
+ I listened to some beats and freestyled in bed until I fell asleep; was fun.
+ Back on my grind this week; starting off kind of slow, but a little green tea should do the trick.
+ Bought a few books on classical -- Trivium -- based eduction. 
  + It will be tough to reprogram & over write the government run complusory schooling, but I think it's a worthwhile goal for the next 10 years.
  + I've got a long way to go to have the mind, body & success I want, but god willing I'll make the next 10 years work for me -- going to be 30 this month -- it's time to stop playing around. I now know what I want & what I don't want out of life. It's still to burn up the old me & free the potental, growth & wisdom that has been fostered the past 10 years.
  + I'm in it for the long game.
+ Removed syndicated videos from my YouTube Channel. Will revisit when it's a larger channel.

  1. Contacted registrar about why domain redirects were not working.
  1. Edited my [Calendly links](https://calendly.com/benjaminspak) for programming mentorship in the evenings after work on the weekend.

# Day 32 | 10.2.2018

*Code* <br>

+ Went HAM on work projects, pretty burnt on coding from that.
+ Started watching [How to build a Reddit or Hacker News Style Web App in Rails 4](https://youtu.be/7-1HCWbu7iU)

*How did I do well?* <br>

+ Pushed back on a project deadline in a firm but polite manner.
+ Completed my next work project in half the allotted time to balance it out.
+ The meditation habit has stuck.

*How can I improve* <br>

+ Start walking on my lunch breaks.
+ Greater variety of meats in my diet to keep me entertained.

*Brain Dump (Performed the following morning)* <br>

+ Created an org structure to for my domains and how I want to brand / market Spak Media LLC.
  + Going to use myself as the figure head & then have individual websites for products.
  + Twitter poll on mentoring name [link](https://twitter.com/benjaminspak/status/1046975165257662465).
  + Setup redirects for several domains.
  + **Need to contact registrar about why their basic wildcard redirects are not working properly.
+ Need to incorporate more exercise in my day.
  + Going to start walking on my lunch breaks.
+ Moving social media management time to my lunch break as well. It's interfering with my side project productivity in the mornings.
+ Having a little trouble sticking to no / low carbs.
  + Need a greater variety of meats in my diet to keep me entertained.
+ Was able to get in writing that my contract with Wells Fargo ends Jan 1st.
  + Helped relieve some pressure.
  + When I spoke with a few recruiters about open positions non of them wanted to pull me from the WF contract because WF is such a huge client for most staffing firms.
    + Which put me in a shitty situation because most companies stop hiring around november & I don't want a gap in my employment.
  + So luckily, I can show my contract terms to recruiters now & have something lined up to segway out of this poorly timed WF contract.
    + Doubtful they will need me to say on or extend the contract, but I'm open to it.

`Symbols` are a one off version of a string and are more memory efficient. 

``` Ruby
"Ruby".object_id

:ruby.object_id
```

`Hashes` are a collection or set of key value pairs.

``` Ruby
who_am_i = {
  :first_name => "Benjamin",
  :last_name => "Spak"
}

who_am_i[:first_name]
=> "Benjamin"
```

`Method` is a block of reusable code.

```
def good_morning
puts "Good Morning"
end
```

`Unless` is the opposite if an if statement. It only runs if false.

```
age = 22
unless age > 65
puts "You're a yougin"
end
```

`.each` method. A method can accept one or more parms within pipe `|` chartacters.

```
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list.each do |number|
puts number * 8
end
```

# Day 14 | Part 1 | 9.14.2018

Woo! Learning CS is fun again! Very excite! For more [Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript - Full Course for Beginners](https://youtu.be/t2CEgPsws3U)

Cheers to [Scott Diemer](https://twitter.com/ScottPDiemer) for mentioning on Twitter that I can just use an `-a` flag in place of `git add .` when stringing Git CLI commands.Re: [Day 13s Tweet](https://twitter.com/benjaminspak/status/1040428854022742016).

Want to expand my programming awareness a little bit today. Watching [Robert C Martin - Functional Programming; What? Why? When?](https://youtu.be/7Zlp9rKHGD4)

Side Note: CS50 wasn't a total waste of time -- still won't continue it -- but, now I'm familiar with C syntax -- which Uncle Bob likes writing his examples in.

**State**

```
1; // a value
in x=1 // x is an id that has a value.
x=x+1; // now x has changed state.
```

The final above line is stateful -- ideally, to build more fault tolerant code we want stateless code -- no variable is altered.

Thought: Ah! So this is why I'm seeing `const` for variable assignment more often in JS than `let` or `var`. I thought I knew, but this adds an extra level of WHY it is done; huzzah!

Stateful code is liable to cause memory leaks -- garbage collection is a merly a hack to deal with the side effects of stateful code.

Why Functional Programming?
+ No temporal couplings.
+ Fewer concurrency issues.
+ Fewer raceconditions.
+ No asking "What's the state?".

Problem:
+ Multi-threading and competing CPU core on a single memory buss.
+ However, if write stateless code; I can exection a hypothetical function on two cores; so long as there's no state change, I'll get the same results.

Ah!!! Recalled from D 12 "All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props."

Now we're cooking with gas! Love it when to seemingly unrelated topics -- Reace | Function Porgraming | matach up and reenforce learning to two areas!

`</ GopherCon Video>`

Okay -- now - back to CS.

**Queue - Data Structure**

+ `FIFO -- First in First out`. 
+ Example: `A line at a store` or a print que.

Main methods of a queue in JS:

+ `.enqueue` -- pushed the first item onto the queue.
+ `.dequeue` -- take an item off of the queue.
  + `.shift` -- removes the first item of an array.
+ `.front` -- returns the first item of an array, without removing the item from the array.
+ `.size` -- size of the queue.
+ `.isEmpty` -- check is a queue is empty.

**Tree -- Data Scructure**

+ All data points in the tree are called `nodes`.
+ The top-most node is called the `root` node.
+ Below that is a `parent node` -- main nodes that have children.
+ `Subtree` a grouping of nodes below the parent node.
+ Below that `siblings` -- have child & parent nodes.
+ Below that a `leaf` -- these nodes have no children.

From personaly experience -- working with the DOM -- I'm familiar with grand parent & grand children nodes being used to label things as well.

**Biary Search Tree -- Data Scructure**

+ A binary tree can only have two branches for every node.
+ Binary search trees are ordered.

+ `Left subtree` is less than or equal to the parent node.
+ `Right subtree` is greater than or equal to the parent node.

On average - operations are able to skip about half of the tree. 
+ Quicker than linear search.
+ Slower than a hash table.

# Day 13 | Part 1 | 9.13.2018

**Common Datatypes CS50 - [Week 7](https://youtu.be/QWnZpgZKOoc?t=28m5s) -- part 2**


**Array**
+ Array's are an advantageous data type because we know the address in memory of where the pointer and subsequent array will be stored.
 + Array's give us random access -- we can jump to an element of an array in constant time BigO of 1.
+ Conversely arrays are poor at expanding in size.
  + An array is a fixed size; you can't really grow it.
  + You need to allocate a larger chunk of memory and move the old element into the new array.
  + Doing this often will present a large time cost as the system needs to reallocate memory often.

**Linked List**

+ A few upsides & downsides over an array. Linking your data in memory is:
 + Quicker to look up.
 + However, takes up more memory.

... Okay, I'm looking for another CS recourse; CS50 is horrible at providing concise lessons ...

[Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript - Full Course for Beginners](https://youtu.be/t2CEgPsws3U)

+ Fucking finally! Useful info! Harvard baby, you're a pretentious dumpster fire.

**Stack - Data Structure** 

+ Stacks follow the `LIFO` -- `Last in First out` principle.
  + Example: `a stack of books`. the last one one on the top would be the first one you remove to access the lower layer books.
  + Real world example: a stack of visited websites.
    + When you visit say -- Facebook.com -- it's added to the stack of your browsing history via a `push`.
    + If you hit the back button in your browser the last item to be added to your history is `popped` off the top of the stack.

  Side note: shout out to [Beau Carnes](https://twitter.com/carnesbeau) for this course!!! Learning a lot already ^_^ 

JavaScript already has all of the array functions necessary to use it as a stack.

+ `push` place an element on the top of a stack.
+ `pop` remove the top element of a stack.
+ `peek` preview the top element of a stack.
+ `length` for determining how many elements are on a stack.

**Sets - Data Structure** 

+ Like an array -- except there are `no duplicate items` & the values are not in any particular order.
+ The typical use of a set is the generally check for the presence of an item.
+ A `union` allows you to combine two sets but, leaves out any duplicates.
+ An `intersection` all of the items in multiple sets, returned as a new set.
+ A `difference` all of the items that are in one set, but not in the other set.
+ A `subset` will test if a set is a subset of another set -- will test if the first set in completely contained within the second set.


# Day 12 | Part 1 | 9.12.2018

**CS50 Week 5 - part 1**

Finally decided to complete CS50 so I have a basic grasp of how low level languages work. Only 7 more weeks worth of videos. At my current pace I'll be done in 1 - 2 weeks.

+ In C `string` is technically `char*` aka a pointer to a location of the first character in RAM.
+ Traditional lecture lead 'teaching' is so dead 💤 ... I wish it wasn't limping on. Maybe once Millenials take over company C-suites & a third parties take the place of colleges in sports recruiting for professional leagues the current system will finally die.

**CS50 Week 5 - part 2**

+ Breaking down the following in this lecture: pre-processing, compiling, assembling, linking.
+ Good to know in theory, but since I'm not taking notes because I won't be working with nor debugging low level langs.
+ Once again 3X video playback is BAE ❤️️ for these dry, repetitive lectures; ~ 120 min worth of lectures in ~ 40 min.

**Lecture 63 + Jr -> Sr. Dev Course**

+ State is a decription of your app. State is an Object that mentions the layout of your app.
+ Props are things that come out of state.
+ A parent feeds the STATE into a child component `STATE >> props`.
  + As soon as the state is fed to a child component, the child component becomes a prop.
  + The child prop cannot change the property; the parent just tells it what the state is.

+ State typically lives in the parent component & passes state to the other child components.

# Day 12 | Part 2 | 9.12.2018

Going through the [React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html); show provide better solid rules, methodologies & principles to follow for React.

+ "Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both." 🙌🙌
+ "You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces in JSX. For example, `2 + 2`, `user.firstName`, or `formatName(user)` are all valid JavaScript expressions."
+ JSX Prevents Injection Attacks: It is safe to embed user input in JSX:

```
const title = response.potentiallyMaliciousInput;
// This is safe:
const element = <h1>{title}</h1>;
```

JSX Represents Objects<br>
Babel compiles JSX down to React.createElement() calls.<br>
These two examples are identical:<br>

```
const element = (
  <h1 className="greeting">
    Hello, world!
  </h1>
);
```

```
const element = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  {className: 'greeting'},
  'Hello, world!'
);
```

+ "These objects are called “React elements”
+ An element describes what you want to see on the screen.
+ "React elements are immutable."

`Note: Always start component names with a capital letter.`

+ "React treats components starting with lowercase letters as DOM tags. For example, <div /> represents an HTML div tag, but <Welcome /> represents a component and requires Welcome to be in scope."

`All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.`

**Spak.co Community Development**

+ Spent time organizing the [spak.tv](http://spak.tv) YouTube channel.
+ Spend some time on Twitter and Instagram soliciting [spak.co](https://spak.co) community sponsors 🤞 -- may not happen today, this week, month, or year -- but, we will find some!

**CS50 [Week 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUAsmwYC2mc&index=13&list=PL2SOU6wwxB0uVbmox-s0PCssse5VKGkWh) -- part 1**

+ Week 6 wasn't in the playlist.
+ Week 7 talks about data storage & recovery.

**CS50 [Week 7](https://youtu.be/QWnZpgZKOoc?t=28m5s) -- part 2**

+ 30 min in we finally get to a hash table! Okay, will need to watch this video from the beginning and take notes. They are talking about data structures.

# Day 11 | Part 1 | 9.11.2018

**CS50 Week 4 -- Part 2**

More C syntax and swapping numbers in an array. 💤<br>

+ A string isn't really text, it's an address of characters in RAM.
+ Pointer == address of something.
+ Therefore a string is an array of characters that point to a stored location in RAM.
  + This explains why in C if you enter two of the same text strings in a CLI prompt they will not evaluate to be the same, because they are both stored in different addresses.

+ ... So glad I primarily code is JS and not C hahah 
+ Now have a new appreciation for higher level languages. While not as performant, I'll happily take that trade off for ease of use.

# Day 11 | Part 2 | 9.11.2018

**Jr to Sr Dev Course -- Lecture 60 - 63**

```
import React from 'react';

const Card = (props) => {
  const { name, email, id } = props;
  return (
    <div className='tc bg-light-green dib br3 pa3 ma2 grow bw2 shadow-5'>
      <img src={`https://robohash.org/${id}?200x200`} alt='robots' />
      <div>
      <h2>{name}</h2>
      <p>{email}</p>
      </div>
    </div>

  );
}

export default Card;
```

+ Reminders:
  + Use `className` vs `class` when defining a class in JSX.
  + use `import React from 'react';` at the top of every React file.
  + Keep classes slim. Only one class to a file.
  + To export the class `export default Card;` at the end of every CLASS.js file.
  + Destructuring props saves your typing `const { name, email, id } = props;` vs having to call `props.name, props.email & props.id`
  + Can make the code cleaner by passing your destructured props in place of your props arg `const Card = ({ name, email, id }) => {`

**Re-watch lecture 63 before work tomorrow**

# Day 10 | 9.10.2018

**CS50 Week 4 -- Part 1**
 
**Merge Sort Algo**

```
On input of n elements:
  If n < 2
    Return.
  Else
    Sort left half of elements.
    Sort right half of elements.
    Merge sorted halves.
```

```
Cut the arrary in half
  Sort the left 1/2 of the original array
    Sort the left 1/2 of the left 1/4 of the split array
    Sort the right 1/2 of the left 1/4 of the split array
  Merge / group - the split 1/4 arrays into ordered 1/2 arrays
  Merge / group - the split 1/2 arrays into a reordered whole array
```

`Efficacy T(n) = 0, if n <2`

```
T(n) = T(n/2) + T(n/2) + n, if n > 1
T(16) = 2xT(8) + 16
T(8) = 2xT(4) + 8
T(4) = 2xT(4) + 4
T(2) = 2xT(1) + 2
T(1) = 0 <-- Base Case
```

Cool! Plateaued on Big O notation. Will need to stop and review tomorrow.

**Jr to Sr Dev Course -- Part 4 -- React, Redux + Bundling**

Haven't been sleeping well, crashed out for a couple of hours after my first day with Well Fargo. So far so good, chill company & team. <br>
Starting with React in the course. Should be an informative refresher.

* React was designed as an alternative to tradition DOM manipulation library's like jQuery.
  * Large code bases get convoluted quickly with tools like jQuery, that's why Facebook developer React -- to help manage large apps.
  * React focuses on using components; reusable blocks of code with markup, style & function built in.
  * One way dada flow - data flows from top to bottom.
  * Virtual DOM - minimizes the amount of DOM manipulation needed.
    * The VDOM is just a Javascript Object which describes the current state of our website.
  * React also creates a separation of concerns - not a separation of tech.

**Robo Friends App**

* create-react-app: Global NPM package which creates a starter project that contains Webpack, Babel & Linters/Debuggers.

Install:<br>
`npm install -g create-react-app`

Create App:<br>
`create-react-app NAME`

Package.json scripts:<br>
`npm start`

+ Reads the React script and starts up our sever.

Package-lock.json:<br>
+ Auto generated by package.json.
+ Ensures the versions number of the dependencies are locked in.

.gitignore: <br>
+ Config file that excludes:
  + Sensitive information like .env database strings & passwords.
  + node_modules & other packages that are already specified in the package.json file. No need for the extra weight & storage usage -- especially in repos.

public/manifest.json: <br>
+ A new feature that allows up to configure our web app settings like name, icons, fav icons & start URL.

src/index.js: <br>
+ Main JS file.
+ Changed `ReactDOM.render(<app />, document.getElementById('root'));` to `ReactDOM.render(<h1>Hello, World!</h1>, document.getElementById('root'));` and previewed in browser to ensure setup is functionung properly.

**RF APP Component 1**<br>
src/index.js
+ `import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';` used to enable React in our web browser. Alternatively, it would be something like `react-native` is developing a mobile app using React.

Tachyons -- A more light weight bootsrap-esk package <br>
`npm install tachyons`

+ Use the new package easily by going to `src/index.js` and `import 'tachyons';`.

**Starting The Complete Junior to Senior Web Developer Roadmap (2018) -- [On Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer-roadmap/)**

Now using `^^` to denote something to look up tomorrow. <br>
Now using `==>` to denote a topic / task has been pushed from the previous day.
<br>

+ 2x video speed is BAE ❤️
+ 🔥 Article [The Developer’s Edge: How To Become A Senior Developer](https://hackernoon.com/developers-edge-how-to-become-a-senior-developer-f1ec1738cf45)

+ **SSH** Had to learn this in my first dev job & with Digital Ocean setup. Speeding through 😎
  
  **New:**

  + Symmetrical Encryption |
  + Key Exchange Algorithm / Asymmetrical Encryption
    + Public keys exchanged -- fine if public keys are intercepted, because private keys (not shared - stored locally) are needed to decrypt the public data transferred.
    + [Secret Key Exchange (Diffie-Hellman) - Computerphile](https://youtu.be/NmM9HA2MQGI)
    + ... Just Googled a logical follow up. "Diffie-Hellman Crack" [Let's talk about that NSA Diffie-Hellman crack](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/10/19/nsa_crypto_breaking_theory/) Go figure 😱 
      + "The Edward Snowden documents revealed that that the NSA had the ability to intercept and decrypt VPN traffic. The on-demand decryption of some HTTPS and SSH connections was also possible because of unspecified but ground break" 😠
      + Dan Brown's novel [Digital Fortress](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Fortress-Thriller-Dan-Brown/dp/0312944926) was spot on.
      + hmm 🤔 when I worked for Comcast most Arris modems/routers would only work with with AES encryption -- which is warned about in the `NSA Diffie-Hellman crack` article.
        + Also, I remember reading about to NSA intercepting commercial grade CISCO routers & Switches over 15 years ago and installing back doors on them. Blarg; America. Still better than China I suppose ... Okay, time to climb out of this rabbit hole.
  + Hashing -- Helps prevent Man in the Middle attacks.
  + Generate RSA Public & Private key pair -- `ssh-keygen -C "test@gmail.com"` |
  + `ls -a` shows hidden files.

Made it though the SSH section of the course. It's 2am. Going to try to sleep again.

# Day 9 | Part 2 | 9.9.2018

Now including search queries. Denoting with eyes emoji `👀`. <br>
Using `...` alternatively for searching or to denote time has passed.

**GitHub Command Efficiency**

+ Breaking my shorthand notes into their own repo ... would like to make running Git Hub creation commands more efficient in the future.
+ 👀 -- how to chain terminal commands -- [Which one is better: using ; or && to execute multiple commands in one line?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/334994/which-one-is-better-using-or-to-execute-multiple-commands-in-one-line)
+ Top response:
  ```

  Cheatsheet:

  A; B    # Run A and then B, regardless of success of A
  A && B  # Run B if and only if A succeeded
  A || B  # Run B if and only if A failed
  A &     # Run A in background.
  ```

+ Copy pasting the GitHub commands info my IDE and adding ` && ` at the end of each line will help with efficacy for now -- less copying and pasting.
+ Moving along ... 🤔 -- still plenty of energy && time for CS50 today.

**CS50 Week 2 -- Part 1**

+ Floats in C |
  + `Casting` -- Example: forcing a data type such as an `Int` to become a `Float` with `(float)`.

  ```
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(void)
  {
    float f = (float) 1 / (float) 10;
    printf("%.2f\n", f);
  }
  ```

  + Trying to view data points past their bit limit causes the computers to begin to approximate values -- often incorrectly.
    + Modern Marvels - [Rocket Failure video](https://youtu.be/yMAvmUyrwlc?t=14m12s)
      + Failure reason(s) - there was a number that required 64 bits to express and it was converted to a 16 bit number instead.
        + The assumption was the number would never need to be that large.
        + The dev team used much of the same software from a previous - slower - predecessor rocket the Ariane 4.
  + In C, variables are scoped to blocks. For example: in order to get a do while loop to function properly variables will need to be declared within a higher scope.

**The Complete Junior to Senior Web Developer Roadmap -- Section 3 - Performance**

**Why we need performant websites**<br>
+ Website response speed effects to bottom line.
  + Google determined that if page load speed took one second longer than normal they would loose $1 Billion per year in ad revenue.
  + Over 50% of users will leave - bounce - if the website takes over 3 seconds to load.
  + The average website makes over 100 requests to load.

**Network Optimizations**<br>
1. Minimize / uglifiy text files -- HTML, CSS, JS.
1. Minimize images.
  + SVG, JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP
  + [File format use cases](https://www.sitepoint.com/gif-png-jpg-which-one-to-use/)
  + [jpeg-optimizer.com](http://jpeg-optimizer.com/)
  + [tinypng.com](https://tinypng.com/)
  + Always lower JPG image quality to `30% - 60%`
  + Resize image based on size it will be displayed.
  + Use media queries to display different size images based on browser window size / client.
  + Use CDNs like [imigx](https://www.imgix.com/) to serve images.
  + Use a tool such as [verexif](https://www.verexif.com/en/) to remove image meta data.
1. Use light wight frameworks that contain smaller, less files.

**Critical Render Path**<br>

`DOM --> CSSOM --> Render Tree --> Layout --> Paint |`

**HTML**<br>
+ Load styles first so the webpage is displayed correctly.
+ Load scripts last -- they block page rendering -- such as CSS style.

**CSS**<br>
+ `CSS is render blocking`.
  1. Only load whatever is needed.
  1. Above the fold loading.
    + Load essential styles via stylesheet calls. Than use JS to call additional styles.
    + This will make the render more asynchronous and serve up content just in time -- after web web page is loaded.
  1. Use less Specificity.

**JS**<br>
+ `Javascript is parser blocking`.
  1. Load scripts asynchronously.
  1. Defer loading of scripts.
    + Run above the fold scripts first. `<script>`
    + Run background scripts such analytics - that do not display to users as async. `<script async>`
    + Run third party scripts that aren't that important or above the fold as deferred. `<script defer>`
  1. Minimize DOM manipulation -- why React.js & virtual DOM are BAE ❤️
  1. Avoid long running Javascript files -- while loop GTFO.

[Prefetching, preloading, prebrowsing](https://css-tricks.com/prefetching-preloading-prebrowsing/)

After going though a solid portion of this content I realized I researched many of these concepts while working @EBG in order to get Adobe Target experiences to be more performant -- also had to use setTimeout() often haha.

However, I never wrote them down. It'll be nice to now have written cheat sheet / check list to come back to.

"Premature Optimization is the root of all evil" 🔥🔥

**CS50 Week 2 -- Part 2**

+ Boring date. Was nice to get out of the house, other than that; poor conversation lol
+ Back to code ... 🔥🔥

The first part of this video is just C syntax and C caveats ... 💤<br>
Stanford algos may be up next 🤔<br>
Skipped ahead about 20 min. Just talking about square bracket selection of indices & arrays.<br>
hmm 🤔 they are talking about crypto in week 3. Okay, I'll check it out. 

**CS50 Week 3 -- Part 1 & 2**
Thank god to 2x speed -- 2x video speed is BAE ❤️ j/k Youtube Playback Speed Control and 3X is BAE ❤️️ It really is the simple things in life ... 🔥🔥<br>
hahah man, if I were paying for this course from Harvard I would be pissed; it's super redundant -- they are calling back to the algo in week 0.

Woo! Okay, [sorting algo @ 16 min in](https://youtu.be/YxgI7ll4Xtg?t=15m37s). Time to slow it down :)

**Bubble Sort Algo**

```
Check number to right of current number
if number to right is smaller
  move that number to the left
if no sorting took place
  sorting is complete  
```

`Efficacy == n squared -- in theory`

**Selection Sort Algo**

```
search and store smallest number
then check the rest of the data for a smaller number
if a smaller number is found, store that number and let go of the previously stored number
then after checking the entire set of numbers, move the ultimate smallest number to the start of the set.
as an optimization, ignore the known smallest number
if a larger number is in the the index of the next smallest number you would like to store, swap the place of the larger and smaller number to place the smaller number in the correct location
  repeat the above pattern for the next smallest number until the sequence is complete
```

`Efficacy == n squared -- in theory`

**Insertion Sort Algo**

```
take the first index and mark it as sorted
check the next unsorted index and compair it to the previous sorted index.
move the smaller of the indices to the left; within the sorted indices.
then sort the stored set similarly to the selection sort algo ...
```

`Efficacy == n squared -- in theory`


# Day 8 | 9.8.2018

+ Updated the [#301DaysOfCode](https://301daysofcode.com) web site. Added a challenge pledge tweet.

**Continuing CS50 -- [Week 1](https://youtu.be/DPJGJ5XOLFQ)**

+ Week 0 part 2 was removed from YouTube, but you can still get the notes (fall 2018 version) on [Havard's Website](https://cs50.harvard.edu/2018/fall/weeks/0/). 

+ Cool part 1 of week 1 has a recap of last weeks problem set & concepts; they covered:
  + Statements
  + Booleans
  + Conditions/branches
  + Loops
  + Functions/procedures
  

**Week 1 -- Part 1 -- Notes**
Now using `|` to denote simple Googleable/familiar concepts for brevity.

+ Source code |
+ Compiler |
+ Object Code |
+ `Source code --> Compiler --> Object Code`
+ `Hello, world!` app in C |
+ Basic Linux CLI commands, flags & args |
+ Clang, make, compiling, handling bugs & infinite loops |

+ I have not seen C code before. Can definitely tell JavaScript & PHP got their syntax roots from C.

**Week 1 -- Part 2 -- Notes**

Downing energy drinks because I wanted to be productive. On to the second video ...

+ API (Application Programming Interface) |
+ Preprocessor directive / include / header file |
+ `\n` new line |
+ Boolean expressions |
+ Switch statements |
+ for loop, while loop, do while loop |
+ black box functions |
+ Huh. `%d` & `%s` are similar to python's approach -- visa versa.

New concepts:
+ A `double` is a `float` with potentially more numbers after the decimal point.
+ A `character` is `8 bits`.
+ A `float` is `32 bits`.
+ A `double` is `64 bits`.

hmm ... may dip in and out of a few videos so I can skip to things I may be unfamiliar with. Or, I think stanford has quality algorithm videos online; may switch to those. TBD.

# Day 7 | 9.7.2018

Watching the first video of [Harvard CS50](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2SOU6wwxB0uVbmox-s0PCssse5VKGkWh). Had gone through the course before, but I wasn't experienced enough to grasp most of the applicability. Now, I'm excited to marry CS theory with my coding experience!

**Linear**

+ Most problems in CS problems are linear.
+ The larger the dataset or problem to solve, the longer it will take.
+ 'n' is the variable used to represent a value.

**Logarithmic**

+ Logarithmic algorithms - such as binary search - "narrows down the search by repeatedly halving the dataset until you find the target value." -[src](https://towardsdatascience.com/linear-time-vs-logarithmic-time-big-o-notation-6ef4227051fb)

![algorithms](https://cs50.harvard.edu/2018/fall/weeks/0/notes/running_time.png)

**What's an algorithm?**

+ A set of instructions to solve a problem, step-by-step.

[Ted Ed Explainer Video](https://youtu.be/6hfOvs8pY1k)

**What is Pseudocode?**

+ English-like syntax that resembles a programming language.

Example:
```
let N = 0
for each person in room
  set N = N +1
```

+ Line 1: declares a variable `N` and initalizes it's value of `0`.
+ Line 2: is a loop.
+ Line 3: how we will go about counting. The indentation implies this is a line that will be repeated.

In other words:<br>
For each person in the room we will increase our count `N` by 1.

**Optimization of the above algorithm**

```
let N = 0
for each pair (2) of people in the room
  set N = N + 1
```

+ The above sudocode is buggy, if there is an odd number of people in the room. However, we can catch this exception by updating our logic.

```
let N = 0
for each pair of people in room
  set N = N + 2
if 1 person remains then
  set N = N + 1
```

+ A `condition` is also known as a `branch`.
+ An `edge Case` is also known as a `corner case`.

**To-to-date CS50 Resources**
[cs50.net](http://cs50.net)

# Day 6 | 9.6.2018

+ Decided to change the branding for SpakMedia on my social media accounts back to my personal name. Seemed to convert better (more followers) with my face & name vs a logo & organization name. 
+ Overall, being more efficient with the time & attention I put into SpakMedia; seems like a wise play. It is difficult to get everyone on the same page and fired up without semi-started projects. Will need to lead from the front.
+ Tossing around some open-source project ideas for [Spak.co](https://spak.co). Projects can be found on our org page on [GitGub](https://github.com/SpakMedia).
+ Also kicking around the idea of transitioning careers to a product manager. I enjoy the merits of code, but working with code for a job & then trying to code as a hobby is daunting. Not all hobbies should be monitized.
+ While I've been kicking around back-end JS & PHP frameworks; I did some research and Ruby on Rails is still one of the hottest back-end frameworks. I think I'll go back to it now that I've had some time to sample what a few languages have to offer. Rails is mature and was fun to work with when I first picked it up. Dig the freedom.
+ Looked at CS resources as well. Will need to fill in some gaps I missed being self taught. Really want to improve my development time & sharpen my problem solving skills.
+ Thinking I will start [CS50](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2SOU6wwxB0uVbmox-s0PCssse5VKGkWh) tomorrow.

**Tonight**

+ Getting listlink.me & devnode.me setup in Cpanel. Also, creating & pushing simple readme.md explainers to our GitHub org.
+ Created Github & command line basics video for 301DaysOfCode newbies.

**Tomorrow**

+ Will want to sketch the UI for listlink.me -- should be straight forward. Also, map out MVP functionality & push to GH.
+ Start CS50.

# Day 4 & 5 | 9.4.2018 - 9.5.2018

Haven't been tinkering with code as much as I'd like to the past couple of days. However! I put to two websites from Wordpress templates to help our community.

+ [Spak.co](https://spak.co) got a facelift & created an overview video for the homepage.

+ [301DaysOfCode.com](https://301DaysOfCode.com) FINALLY setup a v1 website for the [#301DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/301DaysOfCode) challenge.

+ Changed gears a little today and started learning more Laravel. [Laravel From Scratch](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-from-scratch-2017). Only made it a couple videos it, but it was nice to work with something different than Node.



# Day 4 | 9-3-2018

Was working on the Spak.co startup, building out the squad, hosting a few meetings & figuring out new social media marketing strategies for the podcast, twitter, Instagram & YouTube. Finally back to Node :)

**MVC**

+ Touched on MVC & middleware more. MVC in unintuitive; it should be called MCV because you have a data connection (model), a layer that controls the flow and use of that data (controller & middleware) & then the view that is displayed to the edn-user. Just makes more sense that way, to me at least.


**Middleware**

+ Handles the logic after the request but before the response. 
+ Middleware in Node requires the use of the `next` parameter. Example: 

```
(req, res, next)
```

+ Create the logic you want in the controller as well as adding next.

```
exports.myMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  req.name = 'Wes';
  next();
};
```

+ Then add your middleware to the route.

```
router.get('/', storeController.myMiddleware, storeController.homePage);
```

**Schema**

Example schema:

```
const storeSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    trim: true,
    required: 'Please enter a store name!'
  },
  slug: String,
  description: {
    type: String,
    trim: true
  },
  tags: [String]
});
```

If you want to use these `this` keyword you need to use the `function` keyword instead of ES6 arrow frunctions.

```
storeSchema.pre('save', function(next) {
  if (!this.isModified('name')) {
    next(); // Skip it
    return; // stop this function from running
  }
  this.slug = slug(this.name);
  next();
  // TODO make more resiliant so slugs are unique.
});
```

# Day 3 | 8-30-2018:

Note: Signed employment contracts & did several interviews last calendar day 8-29-2018. Still on track for coding 301 days out of 365 😃

+ Picking up on template helpers video #6 w/ learnnode.com

### Day 2 | 8-28-2018:
Going through [Wes Bos's Node.js course](https://LearnNode.com/friend/SPAK) for a quick refreasher. Killer course; I'm sure I'll pick up some things I missed last time.
+ ~~AFK for the day. At a [Tony Robbins / Gary Vaynerchuck speaking event](https://achievesummit.com/events/218). Doing double work on (8-27-2018) for this entry.~~

**Setup**

1. Installed [latest version of node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) form the node.js website.
1. Created a database in [Mlab](https://mlab.com).
1. Checked Node version `Node -v`.
1. Created and move to working directory `\301DaysOfCode\Day-1-Node-JS-Practice\starter-files`.
1. Ran `Node install` on package.json dependencies.
1. Replaced DB connection string & renamed sample environment file.
1. Downloaded, installed and verified database connection (via connection string) with [Mongo DB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#compass).
1. Ran `npm start` to kick start our server locally on `localhost:7777`.

**Routes**

1. Installed [JSON formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa/related?hl=en) to view JSON syntax in Chrome in a user friendly way.
1. Echo a data string onto the page from the address bar. `res.json(req.query);` `example.com?name=sam&cool=true`

  **Routes - Req/Res**

  1. Use the `req` callback function to search the route's code block for statements and logic to run.
  1. Use the `res` callback function to output / display info for the client/browser.
+ [Express API docs](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html).

**Pug(Jade) Template Engine**

+ Pug is indentation based.
+ Added pug classes using dot notation - you can add multiple classes by chaining.
+ Adding IDs are just like classes.
+ You can remove `div` elements prepending class names because div is an implicit element in PUG.

``` PUG
div.wrapper
    p.hello Hello!
    span#yo YO!
```

+ Wrap an `img` element `src` and `alt` attributes in parentheses. Example:

``` PUG
img(src="dog.jpg" alt="Dog")
```

+ You can use a standard HTML <br> tag for line breaks. - Working in MD too, whoops ;)

``` PUG
h2 Hello <br>
  em How are you?
```

+ Passing res from DB to template - pass an object in the render function.

``` JavaScript
res.render('hello', {
    name: 'was',
    dog: 'snickers'
  });
```

+ Interpolating a variable inside of text in PUG templates

``` PUG
p.hello Hello my dog's name us #{dog}
```

+ Interpolating attributes in PUG templates - Use back-ticks instead of quotes.

``` PUG
img.dog(src="dog.jpg" alt=`Dog ${dog}`)
```

+ Blocks are sections of your website/PUG template that can be filled in with other PUG templates/partials.

``` PUG
block header
```

***EOD Note***
Got tired / spacey on the template helpers video #6. Rewatch tomorrow.
