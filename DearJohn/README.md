Dear John,

What important truth do very few people agree with you on?

"Systematic and programmatic stupefication of people."

Itâ€™s a roadmap the power elite  created in the early 1900s and have been rolling out since. Itâ€™s just now starting to worry average IQ people because they can actually see it now Lol

Initally we had the Trivium, which is now reffered to as a "classical" eduction. Grammer, logic & rehetoric. This eduction was primaryily centered around faith (not saying it's good or bad, just is). Then, we moved to compulsory schooling in the late 1800's

Because the robber barrons / industrialists didn' have enough workers for their factories -- they wanted to spend more time with theur families. So, they legally changed it so that chilren had to go to public schools -- unless their parents had the money for a private shcool

Private schools - typically still teach the Trivium. If you remove logic from an education system & the ability to voice that logic -- rehetoric -- then you get plenty of "educted" workers who are great at memorizing and following instructions but don't have the tools

to think for themselves, nor appropriotly voice their opinions. If you do this over generations; people are less likely to notice the cage they are in and the contrainsts put on them.

Through this grooming of the masses over generations, unions are broken up -- stupified masses who can't articulate themselves. Families are broken up -- kids taken away from parents. Mariges are broken up -- no reason for mom's to stay home if the kids are at school all day.

It's the age old divide and conquer strategy -- just over a long period of time so that the masses don't know who to target. Much wiser than the way kings tried to do it 100s of years ago -- in one generation.

Holy shit, what an essay. I am actually not referring so much to education alone but to politics and leaders in general, purposefully abusing their power, media and people's laziness to stay ahead. People are so used to this that they don't actually revolutionazie against it.

What I'm saying is they can't because they don't have the tools to think for themselves. Abuse of power & propoganda is an age old story, my friend. It's nothing new. Look into how the government got Americans - who were not interested in war - into WW1 && WW2. War == money.

I assure you, there is a group of families the 1% of the 1% that are at the top of the food chain.

We're all just animals. How do you train a HUGE elephant to stay still & hold him in place with a tiny little stake in the ground? Start young. The size of the stake doesn't change, only his perception that he is stuck because when he was young it was impossible to escape.

Figuratively speaking, we have more intellectual elephants that we know what to do with. People with huge IQs & some with Ivey league backgrounds who are captives and can't escape.

It's basic economics applied to society. More competition isn't good. Monopolies are what keep things profitable. If a few groups monopolize on the ability to think & passify all possible incumbents, your lead is assured ;)

Even if a few are aware of history the dumb masses will see them as crazy & theorists. It quite brilliant how self-policing society is ðŸ˜‰
