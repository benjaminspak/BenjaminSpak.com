<h2>10 Habits For a More Productive Day</h2>
<p>Wake up at 5am; are you f*ing mad?!</p>
<p>Yes dear reader, but in all the right ways.</p>
<p><b>1</b> <b>Pick a bedtime</b></p>
<p>9:30 PM for me &#8211; Grandpa was a wise man.</p>
<p>Why so early?!</p>
<p>Science! Look up your circadian rhythm and your hormone release times.</p>
<p>Before 10 pm is the ideal time to get to bed.</p>
<p>Bonus:<a href="https://youtu.be/YH91cUoCY-w"> Want To Live Longer? Sleep More!</a></p>
<p><b>2</b> <b>Give yourself time to reflect and plan your tomorrow</b>.</p>
<p>To amend to reflection time; it&#8217;s also important to unplug.</p>
<p>Ideally; stop using anything with a screen a couple of hours before bed. It affects your melatonin production &#8211; the most important sleep hormone.</p>
<p>Bonus: if you&#8217;re up later than expected, at the very least, wear glasses that block the blue light spectrum from your screen.</p>
<p>No, apps like Flux alone are not going to cut it.</p>
<p>Just search Amazon for &#8220;Blue Blocker Glasses&#8221;.</p>
<p>There are more stylish versions but IMHO you need a pair that is going cover the sides of your eyes too.</p>
<p>Get some<a href="https://www.amazon.com/ideas/amzn1.account.AHKIWMO7UI573AFEGUL3SHH7F3IA/30XA6I4BEW8HW"> obscenely large blue blockers</a> that cover your eyes and make you look like a senior citizen who just had LASIK. (No shade on old+ people).</p>
<p><b>3</b> <b>Wake up at 5 am &#8211; no matter what!</b></p>
<p>Protip: ditch the cell phone alarm; get a stand-alone alarm clock and put it across the room.</p>
<p>Having to leap out of bed and run across the room to shut off the blaring default alarm sound will get you up.</p>
<p><b>4</b> <b>Blast some beats or listen to a podcast upon waking.</b></p>
<p>Protip: listen to an inspirational video or podcast to help drown the bag of cats that is your early morning mind. (Jokes folks; just jokes).</p>
<p><b>5</b> <b>Get your pump/sweat on!</b></p>
<p>Protip: Keep it simple; work out 7 days a week, to keep your habit.</p>
<p>I do pushups, squats, rows &amp; curls.</p>
<p>For me, it&#8217;s not about being fit. I force productivity first thing in the morning.</p>
<p><b>6</b> <b>Revisit your day&#8217;s agenda.</b></p>
<p>You outlined what to do last night, now it&#8217;s time to break those larger tasks into smaller chunks of time.</p>
<p>Bonus: If stuck on a task is the middle of the day, break it into smaller subtasks to keep your momentum up.</p>
<p><b>7</b> <b>Cut the crap!</b></p>
<p>On a daily basis ask yourself &#8220;How can I simplify my habits?&#8221;.</p>
<p>Cut time-wasting activities, people &amp; thinking.</p>
<p>Worrying is wasting time on something that hasn&#8217;t happened and may not happen.</p>
<p>Do you need to spend time texting your bff back about gossip?</p>
<p>Nah. Not if you want to be productive.</p>
<p><b>8</b> <b>Filter your incoming data.</b></p>
<p>What is data?</p>
<p>Simple; anything you take in with your five senses.</p>
<p>Rolling your eyes? Good.</p>
<p>Break down the statement.</p>
<p>You may watch TV, listen to podcasts, browse social media, listen to your friends complain and play games.</p>
<p>Ask yourself how you can do any of those less.</p>
<p>Protip: Allot a set amount of time for each non-essential task.</p>
<p>Cutting out things that bring you joy is a quick way to get your mind kicking and screaming like a three-year-old kid throwing a tantrum.</p>
<p>You need fun distractions throughout the day to stay productive.</p>
<p>But! Set a timer.</p>
<p>Limit your exposure to time-wasting activities.</p>
<p><b>9 Food </b>effects<b> mood!</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll say it again because it&#8217;s important:</p>
<p>Food. Effects. Mood.</p>
<p>Everybody is different. Test which foods make you sleepy, and which ones give you energy.</p>
<p>Some people can eat rice while others will start yawning and feeling lethargic after a bowl.</p>
<p>Find what works for you.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb; avoid carbs in the morning. Yes &#8211; that includes fruit and cereal.</p>
<p>Instead, opt for a high-fat first meal.</p>
<p>Your body is primed to digest fats best in the morning.</p>
<p><b>10 Focus on your </b>why<b>.</b></p>
<p>When your mind starts to wander it may ask &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;why are we working towards this goal? Maybe sleep this early in the morning is a good idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can keep your wandering mind in check by reminding it why you are rising early.</p>
<p>My why: To save people time and stress; while improving their quality of life.</p>
