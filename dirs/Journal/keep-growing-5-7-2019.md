### Keep Growing - 5.7.2019

I watched [BUD/s Class 234](https://youtu.be/d7VvfdvIpLI) last night & a few other basic training videos to get inspired. I forgot what I enjoined most about my military service. It was the comradely, fellowship and mutual struggle for greater meaning. Sadly, after the barracks life & group training period was over, I was sent to my first duty station, where I let my physical & mental conditioning go.

I was able to thrive when I was one of many, but not alone. I slept only 4 hours today. I'm tired of my mind having control over over my thoughts. I've been in a cycle of depression and anxiety for months. David Goggins mentions in an interview that the only way to keep his mind at bay is it continuously strive & exercise to exhaustion every day. I saw the same principle in action in Buds class 234. The first three weeks, they were trained until their minds gave way & they bodies were conditioned to lack of sleep & over constant exertion. 

I am inspired to strive towards constant growth. I am tired of being sick and tired. I am ready for struggle; I am ready for true happiness in the face of adversity. This time, rather than try to go it alone, I am using the #301DaysOfHealth hash tag on Twitter. This will help keep me publicly accountable & with hope - motivated. 

I'm planning on snapping a picture of my current state of fitness - or lack there of. I am embarrassed to release it publicly because I will actively seek fat shaming. On days on I do exercise, I will ask people to send me a photo of my current state of obesity as a reminder to get off my ass; eat right & exercise.
