### Learning--5-15-2019

Today I'm studying more React. Currently on video 9/29. I think I will work up to 5 videos per day. That should enable me to complete the course within a week. I will likely take the course again, to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Also, on day two of Hacker Rank. Will complete all day 2 challenges. I have an interview later in the day via Skype at 2:15pm. Excited and a little nervous to speak with the recruiter face to face.

Will also need to doctor up my resume with Angular experience for one of the recruiters I am working with and submit it. 

I've played one game of HearthStone today & meditated once. I anticipate I'll go through that loop again.

Not in much of a mood to do the busy work today, but I did wake up excited to learn more React this morning. So, that is a good sign I suppose.

Ready to find a job in which I can learn & earn a steady wage. I'm hoping Vistanna pans out. I'm excited to work with their team, the leads' seem very knowledgeable.

I will follow up with the recruiter for the Vistanna gig as soon as I am done with this entry.
