I'm really struggling with staying consistent with healthy eating and healthy habits.

 I often find when I get 'bored' and have too much time to think about my current place in life ... 

How I'm not where I wanted to be 10 years ago. I'm not a millionaire. I do not have 5+ close friends. I am not in good physical health. I am not in good mental health. 

Then, there are days where I forget about all that I don't have... 

I stop trying to live up to some lofty abstract idea of success. I focus on the reality of where I am in life. I am exercising. I am eating well. I have a few close friends. My mental health is improving. 

I feel I do not know how to rectify the difference between these two states of mind.

While part of me desires the constancy; as soon as I begin thinking to the future: 

How long will it be before I am healthy? How long will it be before I earn $x? Will I find a woman I can build a life with?

When that line of thinking is entered, a paradox rears its ugly head.

For one to be successful, one much be consistent. 

For one to be constant, one must endure the hardships of life as they come; unswayed by the changing circumstances of life.

And yet, there is another paradox. If you are not willing to change to circumstances of life you will break. 

Therefore, one must be consistent, yet firm. One most be consistent, yet fluid.

When facing both of these paradox's to success, I recall the late, great, Bruce Lee:

“You must be shapeless, formless, like water. When you pour water in a cup, it becomes the cup. When you pour water in a bottle, it becomes the bottle. When you pour water in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Water can drip and it can crash. Become like water my friend.”

― Bruce Lee

I have yet to master these two paradoxes. 

I often sway between anger & fear. 

I become firm & absolute. It alienates people.

I become a drip & small. It lowers my social standing.

Today, I will meditate on the consistency of water. 

How can I be firm, shapeless, formless and yet crash?

How can I ebb and flow with the tide?

How can my emotions be more true to the nature of of water?
