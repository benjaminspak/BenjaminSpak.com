### Stuck--5-13-2019

Woke up at 3:30 am this morning. I cannot sleep. While I was disheartened this weekend with 'my lot in life' I thankfully ruminated about it yesterday and I have a feeling that sprung me into action today.

I responded to a couple of interview related emails; following up. I also applied to more jobs via LinkedIn.

I finally decided to go down to one computer monitor to increase productivity. I read the other day one monitor will substantially increase mental focus to the task at hand. So, I'm giving it a go.

As I think back to what made me happy at age 15, most of it was time spent with friends. In the recent few years, I have nostalgically looked back at that place in time. I have burned for that connection and sense of fellowship. 

However, I have been placing too much weight on the beauty of those moments. When I have though back over the past few years, I have romanticized that place in time. I look at it as if I had no issues, or few issues. Yet, in reality, that was certainly not the case. 

At 15, my father was still an alcoholic. My parents still had a broken marriage. I still lacked what I viewed as 'life experience' and 'social skills'. But, last night and this morning, it dawned on me. 

I'm still living in that past. I am still holding resentment; that I knew. 

But, I didn't know why I was and still am so drawn to that point in time.

I think, perhaps, it has to do will the loss of trust and several friendships from age 15-17. But, also the sense of community, fellowship & warmth I felt. When I knew I had friends, life wasn't perfect, but, it was worth living. It wasn't always fun, but we had each other. That's what I think is truly sticking me in that moment. 

I need to mourn for the loss of friendships I had. Reconcile that friendships end. Forgive and let go of, what at the time I saw as betrayal & finally process though emotions of hurt & anger. 

I will also reach out to friends I still have & see how they are. Life is too short not to enjoy it. And, if I'm honest with myself, I feel like I haven't truly enjoyed it for a few years.

Meditation of the day

What in your past is holding you back? What place in time to you romanticise & wish you could return to? Good or bad, what emotions haven't you processed about a significant life event?
