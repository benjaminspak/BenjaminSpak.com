### Perfectly Selfish - 5.6.2019

Well I'm working on taking up a daily journaling habit to help check in with my state of mind each day and get random thoughts that have been bugging me out. I hope that this will lead to clarity of though and help me focus during my work day. 

It is rather freeing to write a stream of consciousness. Too often, I place a goal on a ritualistic and cathartic task - such as writing. The paradox of this is, I often build up the task too much in my mind and intertwine it with my ego. A simple task such as daily writing for release, looses it's purity as I try to continuously improve and perfect my writing every day.

My struggle with perfectionism pulls the joy out of life. I begin comparing my writing to others & often get stressed that I am not on pare with others, let alone the greats. I hope an honest and transparent flow of words will help other people, but I need to remind myself daily of why I have healthy habits like writing. It's not for them. It's for me. It's for my sanity. It's for my peace of mind. It's okay not to give away everything to everyone. It's okay to be selfish.
