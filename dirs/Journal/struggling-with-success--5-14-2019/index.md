### Struggling-with-Success--5-14-2019

I'm struggling to find motivation today. I am often hopeful that I can do anything. However, I've come to realize I will not be good at everything. Part of me weeps for the lose of potential. The other part of me is slowly accepting that choosing a path is a necessary evil if you want to be successful in life. 

While I could remain knowledgeable about a wide range of subjects, one only has to much time to focus on gaining experience in a few fields. While I would like to be a full-stack developer, it has become more apparent to me, that if I want to have a more stable, well paying position, I will need to specialize.

While I still want to learn Laravel for my own personal projects, it is wise of me to level up my React skills as quickly as possible. I need to start making more projects. I need work to show to hiring managers, so I'm not stuck doing boring programming tests straight out of CS interview books like Cracking the Coding Interview.

I'm finding it difficult to face the fact I do not have enough projects under my belt. I need to take the first step, but it is proving challenging.

Do I fear being successful? Or do I feat being limited to one role? Maybe both.
