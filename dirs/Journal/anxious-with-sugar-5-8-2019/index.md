### Anxious With Sugar - 5.8.2019

My anxiety is strong this morning! I could be that I have an in person interview today. That is usually a large stressor. However, I think it is exacerbated by the sugar I ate last night before bed. Roughly 45g of sugar from yogurt and peanut butter.

I need an alternative to snacks before bed. In an ideal world I would not snack before bed, but when I'm tired I often lack the will power to not snack. I think difficulty sleeping might of also been a side effect of it being to warm in my room. When I run the computer with my door closed it gets up to 84, even thought the A/C is set to 78. As soon as I lowered the temp to 77 I was able to fall asleep.

So, perhaps, not using the computer before bed & leaving my door open for a bit, will cool down my room and aid me in falling asleep faster. I'm also developing a bad habit of using my phone in bed before I go to sleep & when I wake. I should cut this out to help keep my mind's chatter to a minimum. 

Action items:

- Keep door open to bedroom & 10 pm.
- Go outside and use my phone before bed - then, do not touch it after going to bed.
