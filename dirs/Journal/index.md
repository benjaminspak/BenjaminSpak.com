### Routine--5-16-2019

I feel like I've fallen into a pretty decent routine. I'm eating a healthy breakfast in in the morning, which I hadn't been going on a regular basis. Also, making sure I stay way from social media as much as possible. I'm also focused on learning more React development, so I'm excited to see how it pans out in the future. However, I'm trying to stay focused on the day & just enjoy the journey. 

I bought some cigars yesterday. A little bummed I'm smoking again, but it has been helpful with the stress & focus on code; or so I tell myself.

I'm a little worried about an internet friend, Waqar. I've spoken with a few other people I chat with online, on the regular & that haven't heard from him in over a month as well. His default profile picture makes it look like he has depression, so I hope the worse case scenario isn't in play. I'm hoping he's just busy with his family & maybe a new job. Time will tell.

All things aside, I'm making solid progress towards the end of my probation, while trying to keep my head high & look for opportunities to end it sooner than scheduled. We'll see. I may have to take a low paying job soon, just so I can pay the bills; but, that's something to worry about in a month or so.

Enjoying the day as much as possible. Will practice gratitude as needed, to help with my mood and outlook. Didn't sleep well last night, woke up at three with racing thoughts, but after practicing gratitude, I was able to fall back to sleep. 

I'm thankful for having Lonnie & his family in my life, they have been a god send.
