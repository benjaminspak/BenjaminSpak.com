### thankful-new-video-format--5-17-2019

It's Friday! I'm exciting this morning because I applied to several remote roles last night and got a solid 10% or so response rate. I also posted on Twitter & LinkedIn that I'm looking for a position and a few people in my network (Twitter) reached out and offered to help.

Very thankful for my network and cultivating relationships with people online! I'm also thankful for Wes Bos's React courses. I'm continuing to learn React this week & will do so thru the weekend as well.

I'm increasing my bi-curls lift from 10 lbs x 20 rep to 30 lbs x 5 reps to throw my body a curve ball. I'll likely decrease the weight again next time I work out. I should hit some of the other muscle groups like my back today or tomorrow for good measure. I need to get my core strength up. 

Overall a good day. I stayed up too late - early am - playing Hearthstone. I'm hooked on the new solo challenges that they have.

I will complete my weekly video for my YouTube channel "What 5 things Jr devs need to know" but I think I'm going to try a three tip format for now. It's easier to come up with three points & I"m hoping I'll hold people's attention for the duration of the video and increase my watch time stats.
