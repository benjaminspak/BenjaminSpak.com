Reselling Business Guidelines

1. Quality Pictures (use flash, lighting, etc)
1. Sell niche items. Great chance of a profit. Popular items are highly competitive & easily under cut by competitors.
1. Diversify the items you sell. Markets are always changing. Don't let hanging circumstances kill your business model.
1. Buy tracking for all of your packages. It will save you money and stress in the long run when deliveries are contested.
1. Allocate roughly 30% of your profits for taxes.
1. Keep a receipt/Bill of sale for items you buy or sell on Craigslist.
